## Film Query Overview

Using the Film Query app the user can search from a database containing a list
of 1,000 films, including the all time classic Academy Dinosaur. Simply enter a
films id number and the app will also display the films length, rating, a
description, and the actors starring in the film. What's that? You have no clue
if Academy Dinosaurs id number is 1, 42, or 999? Well then you can use the search
by keyword function and the app will return a list of films that contain your
keyword.

### Lessons Learned

Learning the syntax of translating what I want done in MySQL via Java in Eclipse.
Which while typing out the code and reformatting it I made one fat-fingered mistake
that I did not catch until I watched the program blow at run time. So more of a
reinforcement of double checking my work as I go to not waste hours of time down
the road. Being deliberate with how the MySQL SELECT variables were defined did
help keep track of what was being searched where. Instead of using an integer
and hoping I did not miscount deliberately linking the get function with its
opposite in the String sql seemed to reduce errors.

### Plan of Attack

Get a menu going. Move on to the film id search function. Once that was working
then I implemented the code for the search by keyword. Throw in the films
language and the actors involved.
